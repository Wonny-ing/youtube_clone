          "description": "We Survived Antarctica... The Ice Planet. this was insane. There is nothing but snow, ice, mountains, and rock. We tried living in the wilderness. It was not what we expected.\n\nCash App: https://cash.app\n\nFollow my socials:\n➽ Twitter - @dream\n➽ Instagram - @dreamwastaken\n➽ Snapchat - @dream\n\nMrBeast: @MrBeast \nKarl: @Karl \nGeorge: @GeorgeNotFound \nSapnap: @Sapnap \n\nAfter years of being completely faceless online, I finally decided to do a face reveal, and after that my life completely changed. MrBeast took me to Antartica, and it was some of the craziest days of my life.\n\nAntarctica is nothing like anywhere else on earth. The sun never sets, the snow is deeper than you can dig, and the wind is hurricane-like at all times. You have to wear special gear to go outside, to avoid frostbite and also snow blindness. It felt like living on a different planet. The Ice Planet.\n\nAntarctica was incredibly cold, and surviving 50 hours in the wilderness was crazy. It was actually pretty fun, despite the fact I had 3 different illneses at the same time while I was there. I was constantly freezing and coughing, but I still managed to have fun. There were some scary moments, and lots of fun moments with my friends.\n\nBeing able to finally do this stuff in real life is awesome. I never would have thought in a million years that George, Sapnap and I would be traveling to Antarctica instead of filming another Minecraft Manhunt (maybe soon?!). I still want to do one in real life as well. Sorry for the lack of uploads!\n\nFun fact: Antarctica is the biggest desert on earth!\n\nMore Minecraft Survival soon... was kind of busy freezing...",

            "description": "We Survived Antarctica... The Ice Planet. this was insane. There is nothing but snow, ice, mountains, and rock. We tried living in the wilderness. It was not what we expected.\n\nCash App: https://cash.app\n\nFollow my socials:\n➽ Twitter - @dream\n➽ Instagram - @dreamwastaken\n➽ Snapchat - @dream\n\nMrBeast: @MrBeast \nKarl: @Karl \nGeorge: @GeorgeNotFound \nSapnap: @Sapnap \n\nAfter years of being completely faceless online, I finally decided to do a face reveal, and after that my life completely changed. MrBeast took me to Antartica, and it was some of the craziest days of my life.\n\nAntarctica is nothing like anywhere else on earth. The sun never sets, the snow is deeper than you can dig, and the wind is hurricane-like at all times. You have to wear special gear to go outside, to avoid frostbite and also snow blindness. It felt like living on a different planet. The Ice Planet.\n\nAntarctica was incredibly cold, and surviving 50 hours in the wilderness was crazy. It was actually pretty fun, despite the fact I had 3 different illneses at the same time while I was there. I was constantly freezing and coughing, but I still managed to have fun. There were some scary moments, and lots of fun moments with my friends.\n\nBeing able to finally do this stuff in real life is awesome. I never would have thought in a million years that George, Sapnap and I would be traveling to Antarctica instead of filming another Minecraft Manhunt (maybe soon?!). I still want to do one in real life as well. Sorry for the lack of uploads!\n\nFun fact: Antarctica is the biggest desert on earth!\n\nMore Minecraft Survival soon... was kind of busy freezing..."

The first game is my favourite of all time and I've bought the ps3 version, the ps4 remaster and even the ps5 remake that released a couple of months. This is a game I've completed numerous times on grounded mode and the series is something I've been desperate to do a deep dive on.\n\nThroughout this video we're gonna be breaking down the first episode scene by scene and talking about all the easter eggs, hidden details and what they did differently to the game. If you haven't played it then don't worry because we won't be spoiling what happens down the line as I want you to enjoy the twists and turns as much as I did on my first playthrough.\n\nHowever I may need to touch upon certain things due to characters that get name dropped here but I'll only bring them up in a spoiler section at the end of the video which I'll give you a heads up on.\n\ni'm nice like that\n\nNow unlike the game, the series starts off in 1968. Originally we watched as Sarah woke up in her bed and ventured about the house but here they do it differently. Rather than throwing us in at the night of the outbreak we get some backstory that wasn't even filled in in the source material. The game told us very little about the virus beyond it being cause by Cordyseps which had mutated to infect humans. These real life funghi exist in the jungle and the parasite infects insects and anthropods. Beginning in 1968 though we see a tv show in which two scientists do a big theory time about what the biggest threat to humanity is.\n\nThe first one goes off about how we may have a pandemic level event that's caused by a strain of influenza. Both games were made before Covid 19 and the creative team have kinda retroactively added this into the show to comment on it I think. The scientist mentions how airplanes are a new element that will help viruses like this spread easier and later on we see several planes flying overhead as Sarah, Joel and Tommy make their escape.\n\nThey add a lot of focus to them during the car scene and actually change up how the crash happens. Originally it was caused by another car hitting them but they do a fake out in the episode and instead have  plane debris causing it.",
